<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Rahe, and I’m a 22-year-old engineering student with a passion for innovation and problem-solving. Currently, I'm immersed in my studies, focusing on mechanical engineering at UAV, where I'm honing my skills in design, analysis, and project management.

  <br>From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how things work and have always loved dismantling and reassembling gadgets to understand their inner mechanics. This curiosity naturally led me to pursue engineering, where I get to blend my love for mathematics and science with creativity and practical applications.
  
  When I'm not buried in textbooks or working on my latest project, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, playing soccer with friends, or indulging in my hobby of building and flying drones. I’m also deeply committed to sustainability and often volunteer for local environmental initiatives, aiming to integrate eco-friendly practices into engineering solutions.
  
  Balancing my academic life with extracurricular activities, I am a member of the university’s engineering club and have participated in several competitions, where my team and I have developed innovative prototypes that aim to solve real-world problems.
  
  I’m always eager to learn new things, meet interesting people, and take on challenges that push my boundaries. <br>My goal is to use my engineering skills to make a tangible difference in the world, whether that’s through developing cutting-edge technology or contributing to sustainable development.
